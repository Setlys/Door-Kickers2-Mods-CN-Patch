@nwcy_constable_desc=局里最常见不过的普通巡警，时刻肩负着维护秩序、设立检查站和装作自己知道到底在做什么的重任。\n装备烂，训练少，运气是他们出警时唯一可以信任的东西。

@nwcy_sergeant_desc=身上随时带着一枚警徽、一支笔和一股挥之不去的老资历臭味的中层管理人员，\n通常会干的事情只有缩在掩体后面发布命令、填没人会去读的报告，或者在事情办成后跑出来认领功勋\n——最后这件事情发生的几率近乎于零。

@nwcy_special_unit_desc=警局上下的所有“精英”汇聚于此，带着更好的装备、更酷的瞄具和更过度的自信心执勤。\n通常在局势失控时出警，然后把整件事“摆平”到需要总统出面的地步方才罢休。

@nwcy_plainsclothes_desc=一帮精于在大街上走路时都显得非常可疑的卧底警员，即使混入民众中也如迈克尔杰克逊般耀眼。\n虽然手中的武器非常的过时，但通讯方式则极其的时髦——无事时微信，有事时短信。

@nwcy_unit_desc=诺维哈基虽引以为傲但毫无作为的警队，上至特警下至巡警都只能靠着过时的装备、漏洞百出的训练和不绝于耳的吼叫声维护法律。

# Weapons - Pistols

@firearm_m9_nwcy_sup_desc=给你的社区警务添点色，如90年代的三角洲一般，带着这把重达两斤，长达半米的战术武器潜入夜色中的巴尔干群山——反正也没有什么枪能比这把M9更能体现“邻里守望”的精髓了。\n\n说到底，你用这把枪到底是为了什么？是想躲在阴暗的角落里对着20米开外的毒贩打冷枪，还是想不被发觉地一路摸到无业游民的身旁？这把枪又长又重，而且还塞不进你的枪套里，唯一的好处就是热狗摊的小贩会在你拿这把枪指着他的时候多挤点芥末酱给你。

@firearm_g17_nwcy_desc=荣登警局最靓配枪榜榜首的武器——这个榜其实挺像个野榜的，考虑到排行第二的是锈迹斑斑的TT33，而第三的是便宜M1911仿品——且使用塑料制成，别急，是格牢靠的工程塑料。\n\n虽然没有手动保险，但是有其道理，你只需抬枪瞄准，轻扣扳机，然后埋头填写报告即可。别笑，警局里配发到这把枪的巡警都是这么走流程的，所以大伙对这把枪是又尊敬又疑惑，结果总结出了一句相传于警官之间的传言：拿到这把枪的人要么是要升官了，要么是填报告时把上司写成了嫌疑人。

@firearm_m1911_nwcy_desc=虽然很过时，但是很可靠，击中比路牌大的目标可谓是绰绰有余。使用这把柯尔特侦探型左轮手枪的人有着来自他的“整天填报告填到想杀人”警司的全权授权，可以向嫌犯发射完全不致命，但仍然会让他受罪的.38特种弹。\n\n这把左轮尤其受迷信的警官喜爱，他们认为快速装弹器是一种实体巫术，而后坐力则是上天施加在枪口的魔法。

@firearm_tt33_nwcy_desc=苏联解体后最受第三世界国家的孩童喜爱的玩具枪，使用“理论上可在人体内滚出一条致命创口”的7.62x25mm托卡列夫弹，这把手枪就是人们常说的“我用它不是因为我有品位”的那种武器。\n\n握把又薄，枪声又大，握持不当还可能对你的虎口造成致命打击；保险缺位，外表朴实，在使用中散发出二战的残存气息后便散作满天星。\n即便缺点如此之多，TT-33仍然是巡警们的主要武器，再说了，这枪出厂后过了这么久还能开火，要啥自行车？

@firearm_m9_nwcy_desc=调拨经费的政府官员经常会问局长一个问题：局里有这么多的便宜冷战货能用，为什么要花大钱买那些更现代的手枪呢？局长气沉丹田，吐出四个大字：它有保险。\n\n话虽这么说，局里还是有很多人喜欢使用这把又重、又容易出小毛病、还容易误触保险的M9手枪，这类人具有以下共同点：老派、喜欢长行程扳机、倾向于在出警和写报告之间找一个平衡点，方便偷懒。

@firearm_22lr_nwcy_desc=尽管看着老旧，但是开火时依然无声的老学校消音手枪，通常配发给需要隐秘行动的警员——“隐秘”的意思是行动时发出的声音比菜市场的动静小声就行。\n\n这把枪很小，射速很慢，开火时就像一位在抽烟室里吞吐烟圈的老绅士；子弹的停止力虽然很大，但至少不会吵醒隔壁熟睡的老穆罕默德。

@firearm_ppk_nwcy_desc=一把影视史上的经典手枪，常被英伦间谍所使用——现在用这把枪的一般是那些觉得自己也很“英伦”的警官。\n\n这把枪很小，小到吓不住任何人，使用的弹药也是那种要在命中前礼貌询问目标“能否让我损伤您的肌肉”的子弹，配发这把枪纯粹是因为仓管在翻仓库时意外找见了一整箱的这玩意，仅此而已。

@firearm_ppk_sup_nwcy_desc=能有什么比带了一把小口径手枪的警察更能体现警察部门的暴力机关属性？答案是带了一把安装巨大消音器的小口径手枪的警察。\n\n很适合用来礼貌地要求某人投降——前提是你得在他背后，直接把这把枪的枪管捅到他的脊椎上。这并不是说在警务实战时拿着这把枪的警官就一点用都没有，相反，这位警官是在大声地向所有人释放一种信号：这人是个酷哥，别惹他。这根消音器为此起到了什么作用？答案是在显摆时为警官增添一股詹姆斯邦德般的神秘感，并在使用时立刻炸成碎片。

#
# Weapons - Shotguns
#

@firearm_slinged_hunting_shotgun_nwcy_desc=这把看着就像是为堑壕战而生的霰弹枪一直挂在警局的枪架上，还被贴了张“非紧急情况勿用”的标签在上面；其实也不无道理，这把枪的牢靠程度估摸着也就比老穆罕默德的腰好一点。\n\n两根枪管，两次机会，每次射击都要向真主祈祷子弹不会射偏。你问打歪了怎么办？先给嫌犯磕几个头，认个爹，趁他高兴的时候抓紧把子弹抠出来。说到底，这枪在警务实战的时候更像个扩音器，用处就是向嫌犯叫两声，劝他们别不识好歹抓紧投诚。警官们更倾向于带这把枪去镇暴，毕竟镇暴还真就需要声音大的家伙事。

#
# Weapons - Various Primary
#

@firearm_ak_underfolder_constable_nwcy_desc=枪托摇摇欲坠，成色久经沙场，但依然是整个警局里最可靠的东西——甚至比供电系统可靠。用这玩意就像是往坏掉的烘干机里直接扔一个工具箱进去：虽然过程很曲折，最后还是能把机器修好。\n\n一般人看到折叠托就会觉得这把枪很“紧凑”，按这种逻辑的话撬棍其实也挺“紧凑”的。拿到这把枪的警官通常会痛哭流涕，感谢局长终于让他们从文物收藏者一跃成为了真正的战士。

@firearm_smlemk3_constable_nwcy_desc=“栓动警务”模式的最佳代表。李-恩菲尔德步枪为捍卫日不落帝国而生，现在却只能屈尊降贵，用于恐吓乱穿马路的行人，并在过程中射穿整整两个街区的墙。\n\n很多警员都觉得拿着栓动步枪去执法非常荒诞，因为整枪上下唯一有助于减少文书工作的只有枪口前面的刺刀箍。但这并不是说这把枪全无用武之地，在长距离射击和镇暴时，警员们仍然会选择带着这把枪出勤，一些巡警还借此发现了一个比较奇特的用途——在响应劫案时带上这把枪，比较蠢的劫匪就会觉得他们穿越回了上个世纪，进而放松警惕，警员们趁此机会得以偷袭他们。

@firearm_pm63_constable_nwcy_desc=PM63之于警员就如同靠关系进公司的实习生之于正式工——没人知道这家伙怎么进来的，但反正就是在。PM63的设计非常符合实际表现：25发弹匣和高射速使得清空弹匣无比迅速；折叠托抵不住肩，十个警员里有九个在连射时上不了靶；人机工效堪比订书机，开火时整把枪和滚筒洗衣机一样吵闹。\n\n警官们同意这把枪能当副武器使吗？可能。警官们同意这把枪该进博物馆吗？毫无疑问。经过讨论后，警官们一致认为PM63只适合一种人使用：在出警时嘴里念念有词，不时高喊“遭遇”“弱侧有敌人”“卧倒”“出掩体”“enemy down”的战术奇人。

@firearm_m16a4_constable_nwcy_desc=联军的军剩物资，上级将这些枪批给了警局，期盼着警员能用它们重振治安。虽然可靠又精准，但是指望巡逻都只喜欢去超市绕圈的巡警用这个还是太强人所难了。\n\n这批步枪发配给警员后，警局似乎无声无息地军事化了。警官们上街巡逻时不再是以维和者的形象出现，而是变成了和联军士兵一模一样的“丘八先生”，上级甚至期望他们能和联军一起抗线。到这种地步，已经不是维护社区这么简单了，警官们自己也能感受到，他们实际上是在干压制反对派的活。

@firearm_m500_constable_nwcy_desc=M500不是发给你的，而是硬塞给你的，因为你是第一响应者；如果事态已经严重到要把M500从后备箱里拿出来的话，那你作为第一响应者最需要的“时间”已经所剩无几了。\n\n只有准星的泵动霰弹枪和几盒霰弹的搭配最适合在分秒必争时破门而入，控制事态了。结构简单、声如洪钟、且过目难忘——M500正是为此而生的。

@firearm_m4_carbine_heavy_nwcy_desc=能拿到M4的单位绝不会和街上那些“甜甜圈巡警”一样废柴。M4紧凑而又精准，所填装的5.56x45mm弹药极其适合在城镇环境中遂行快反行动。\n\nM4在局里可不是人人皆有的平民装备，拿到这把枪的单位一般都会承担快反任务，这种任务既要快，也要狠，更要准——一般的巡警应付不了这种要求。

@firearm_m4_carbine_sup_heavy_nwcy_desc=Outfitting the M4 Carbine with a suppressor is less about silence and more about control. Reduced recoil, lower muzzle blast, and better handling in confined spaces make it a smart addition for police units operating in dense urban environments.\n\nIt’s still a 5.56×45mm workhorse — just refined. For special units, this isn’t about flash — it’s about staying effective, coordinated, and in control when it counts.

@firearm_mp5_heavy_nwcy_desc=The MP5 is the go-to standard for special police units, and for good reason. Chambered in 9mm, it offers controllable automatic fire, compact handling, and excellent accuracy in close-quarters scenarios.\n\nIts reputation isn’t just legacy, it’s earned. Reliable, precise, and easy to maneuver in tight spaces, the MP5 fits the role perfectly when operations demand speed, coordination, and minimal collateral risk.

@firearm_m500_heavy_nwcy_desc=The Mossberg in the hands of a special unit isn’t for intimidation. It’s for breaching doors, clearing rooms, and ending standoffs quickly. Chambered in 12-gauge, it brings raw stopping power to situations where hesitation isn’t an option.\n\nIt’s not subtle, not elegant, but brutally effective. When subtlety ends at the threshold, this is what makes the opening statement.

@firearm_akm_heavy_nwcy_desc=The AKM might be old, but in the hands of a special unit, it’s far from obsolete. Chambered in 7.62×39mm, it delivers heavy-hitting power with the kind of rugged reliability that doesn’t care about dust, mud, or budget constraints. Paired with modern sights and a bit of refinement, it bridges old design with current demands. Not fancy, not fragile — just dependable firepower with a modern touch.

@firearm_aks74u_heavy_nwcy_desc=Issued to special units who need speed, not range. Compact and easy to handle in tight alleys or cramped stairwells, it’s built for quick response in unpredictable environments.\n\nWhile it lacks the precision of a full-length rifle, its reliability and fast handling make it ideal for urban operations — raids, high-risk arrests, and crowd control when things turn volatile. It’s not perfect, but for close-quarters police work, it’s more than enough.

@firearm_apc9k_heavy_nwcy_desc=A sleek, modern 9mm SMG totally unsuited for the dusty chaos it’s dropped into. Issued to special units who wanted to look professional — and occasionally hit what they’re aiming at. Low recoil, high rate of fire, and just compact enough to justify kicking doors they could’ve opened quietly.\n\nTechnically not standard issue — these were “borrowed indefinitely” from a SWAT shipment that never made it past customs. Tactical redistribution, Nowheraki style.

@various_shieldIII_heavy_nwcy_desc=The Level III shield wasn’t exactly issued — the unit “borrowed” it from a SWAT team that probably still wants it back. Rated to stop rifle rounds, it’s bulky, heavy, and hard to carry, but when things go loud, it’s the only thing keeping the front man standing.\n\nIt’s not comfortable, and it’s definitely not subtle, but for a unit expecting the worst with minimal gear, it’s a lifesaver. Improvised logistics, professional intent.

@firearm_mini_uzi_pistol_desc=The Mini Uzi pistol isn’t standard issue — it’s what special units grab when subtlety takes a backseat to volume. Chambered in 9mm and small enough to stash under a vest, it bridges the gap between sidearm and submachine gun with all the finesse of a firehose.\n\nIt’s fast, loud, and wildly excessive for most situations — which is exactly why they carry it. When a pistol won’t cut it and a full SMG is too much bulk, this little brute fits right in.

@firearm_fn_fal_nwcy_desc=The “Right Arm of the Free World,” now in the shaky hands of underpaid constables. Fires a powerful 7.62mm round and your shoulder with equal force. Issued when someone wants to look serious but can't afford optics, training, or modern rifles. Accuracy depends on luck, recoil, and how many times it’s been dropped since the Cold War.

# Armors
#

@armor_nwcy_vestII_desc=A thin layer of hope in a country where most threats come in 7.62x39mm. It’ll stop a pistol round on a lucky day, but against an AK? You’re basically wearing optimism.\n\nIssued more for appearances than protection, it’s light, breathable, and completely unhelpful in a firefight. But hey, at least it looks tactical — right up until someone brings an actual rifle.

@armor_nwcy_vestIII_desc=The department's idea of “serious gear” for constables facing not-so-soft threats. Thicker than Level II and twice as sweaty, it offers just enough protection to make you feel safer — but not enough to test it.\n\nWorn proudly during “high-risk” operations, like raiding a shack with known AK fire in the area. It won’t stop a full rifle round, but it might stop paperwork from hitting too hard. And really, that’s what counts.

@armor_nwcy_vestIII_heavy_desc=Level III soft armor for the special unit, technically better than standard issue, and just soft enough to remind you it’s still not a plate carrier. Designed for mobility, but really just a heavier hug from budget constraints.\n\nIssued to those expected to breach first and get shot at the most, it might stop a rifle at point-blank with divine intervention. But hey, it's sleeker, has velcro, and says “tactical” on the label — which is all that matters during the debrief.

@armor_nwcy_platecarrier_heavy_lvlIII_desc=Now this is the real deal — a proper plate carrier, complete with actual SAPI plates, and all the attachments to make the special unit look like they just walked out of a military recruitment poster.\n\nBut beneath the pouches and patches? Still a third world police force, riding to the op in a pickup with one working door and a flat spare tire. Sure, the gear screams elite — until the radio dies, the backup doesn’t show, and someone’s still writing reports on paper from 2004.

@armor_nwcy_platecarrier_heavy_lvlV_desc=Outfitted with Level IV ESAPI plates, this carrier is the pinnacle of protection — heavy, expensive, and way too advanced for a force that still shares one pair of night vision goggles. You could take a 7.62 AP round to the chest and live… assuming the heatstroke doesn’t get you first.\n\nIt screams elite status, but let’s not forget: you're still coordinating over WhatsApp, riding in a pickup with no tailgate, and relying on a guy named “Sergeant Wi-Fi” to upload mission reports. You may look invincible, but the logistics still say third world.

@nwcy_helmet_pasgt_desc=A rugged piece of “military surplus” with more dents than protection. Issued to special units for that elite look — offers the illusion of safety and a guaranteed headache.

@nwcy_helmet_ach_desc=A slightly modern helmet “reassigned” from a better-funded SWAT team. Offers decent protection, a built-in ego boost, and just enough padding to muffle bad decisions. Still doesn’t come with proper training.

@nwcy_helmet_pasgt_constable_desc=Old, heavy, and questionably effective — much like the officer wearing it. Pulled from a dusty warehouse and “reissued” with pride, it provides just enough protection to meet regulations, but not enough to stop a bad day.

@nwcy_plainclothing_undercover_desc=An unbuttoned dress shirt two sizes too big, perfect for blending in with street vendors and absolutely no one else. Comes pre-wrinkled, sweat-stained, and ready for suspicious stares.

@nwcy_cop_undercover_desc=Faded, dusty, and instantly recognizable — the kind of uniform that says “I take bribes,” even if you don’t. Perfect for blending in with the rest of the force while quietly gathering intel from the inside. You’re a cop pretending to be a worse cop… and somehow, it’s working.

@nwcy_insurgentdisguise_undercover_desc=Surprisingly convincing from a distance — loose-fitting clothes, worn sandals, and just the right amount of grime. So authentic, you could probably walk through a checkpoint with an AK sticking out of your ribs and no one would question it. Just don’t get too close or say too much — one wrong word, and you're the next "suspected outsider."

#
# Misc

@nwcy_police_badge_desc=A shiny piece of metal that magically grants authority, confusion, and occasional free tea. Worn proudly on crumpled uniforms, it’s less about upholding the law and more about looking official while doing questionable things.

# Doctrines
#

@nwcy_handgun_shortrangedrill=The constables learns to hold their sidearm with both of their hands for accurate close range fire — up to 7 meters. Impressive.
@nwcy_handgun_mediumrangedrill=The constables now try using their sights when firing beyond spitting distance — accurate shots up to 15 meters. Revolutionary.
@nwcy_handgun_longrangedrill=Through advanced training at the academy, with guidance from SWAT instructors and military combat advisors, constables are now proficient in engaging targets with their sidearms at distances up to 50 meters.
@nwcy_handgun_fastreload=After months of fumbling pockets and dropping mags, constables finally figured out how to reload without looking like it's their first day. Efficiency, sort of.
@nwcy_handgun_shotplacement=With improved marksmanship, constables now place shots on the torso instead of the general vicinity. About time.
@nwcy_handgun_iscoscelesstance=Advised by the foreign instructors: a pistol stance that improves recoil control and front-facing armor coverage. Tactical, practical, and geometrically sound.

@nwcy_rifles_burstfiring=Constables now use short bursts instead of trying to win the engagement with sheer volume of fire. The walls are grateful now.
@nwcy_rifles_controlrecoil=Constables have discovered that bracing the rifle against the shoulder actually helps control recoil. Who knew basic posture mattered?
@nwcy_rifles_accuracyfocus=Constables have learned that taking a moment to actually aim improves accuracy at all ranges. Revolutionary concept: hitting what you shoot at.
@nwcy_rifles_precisiondrill=After endless drills and a few near-misses involving traffic signs, constables can now shoot with actual precision. Turns out practice does make slightly better.
@nwcy_rifles_obscuredcover=After repeated training in simulated urban environments, constables are now capable of placing accurate shots through tight angles, minimizing the protection hard cover offers to suspects.
@nwcy_rifles_surgicalshooting=After repeated training in simulated urban environments, constables are now capable of placing accurate shots through tight angles, minimizing the protection hard cover offers to suspects.
@nwcy_rifles_magazines=What felt like a thousand reloads and a minor war against gravity, constables can now swap magazines without launching them into orbit. Miraculous.
@nwcy_kavaristance=Supposed to improve rifle handling and armor protection, but most constables just copied the dramatic pose and hoped for the best. Still, somehow, their shots land straighter — whether through training or sheer bravado.

@doctrine_nwcy_constableacademy=The first step to becoming a professional door-kicker. Unlocks follow-up training in pistol and rifle handling for Constables. Also includes a brief lecture on ethics, which most skipped to get to the range.
@doctrine_nwcy_pistoltraining=Sidearm training for Constables and gives them just enough training to not shoot their foot off. Accuracy and reloads slightly improved. Safety not guaranteed, but enthusiasm is.
@doctrine_nwcy_rifletraining=Grants training for Constables to hand-me-down rifles. They're not quite marksmen, but they now understand which end the bullets come out of — usually.
@doctrine_nwcy_foreignadvisors=Enhances the quality of the Constable training. These advisors come from places where training is serious, gear is used properly, and you don’t ask what happened to the last squad.
@doctrine_nwcy_melee=Grants Constables a melee stun bonus. Based on a real event where a foreign advisor "accidentally" demonstrated a technique on a high-ranking officer. Effective, painful, and now standard practice.
@doctrine_nwcy_motorskills=Improves speed when interacting with explosives and deployables. Constables now wire-cut, arm, and disarm like they’ve done it at least twice in a simulation.
@doctrine_nwcy_throwingtraining=Increases throwable speed. Foreign advisors were hesitant to teach this… for good reason. But with enough practice (and trauma), the constables got the hang of it — mostly.

@doctrine_nwcy_increasedfunds=The budget got padded after some “creative accounting.” The station got new curtains. Patrol cars still don’t have brakes.
@doctrine_nwcy_firstaid=Minor wounds are now treated with something better than tape and a stern lecture. Reduces recovery time for injured troopers during campaigns. Field medics are still unpaid interns, though.
@doctrine_nwcy_ambulanceservices=Upgrades the “drag him behind the car and hope” method. Increases survival chances from 30% to 60% when a unit is downed. The sirens are real, the drivers slightly less so.
@doctrine_nwcy_anticorruption=A bold initiative to clean house. Internal Affairs now watches everything, even the coffee machine. Doesn't change gameplay — but it makes everyone nervous enough to follow the actual briefing.
@doctrine_nwcy_strictrules="If you're not early, you're late. If you're not in cover, you're dead." Enforces faster reaction time and procedural discipline. Also adds more paperwork if the Constables break protocol. Yay.

@doctrine_nwcy_straightarrows=As a result of all the rules and reforms, the precinct now runs like a tight, slightly paranoid ship. Units operate with improved consistency, accuracy, and professionalism, which is weirdly unsettling.
